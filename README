Program written using C and OpenMP

Conway's Game of Life takes a matrix filled with 1s and 0s
  Determines the value in each cell of the next matrix generation based on the values surrounding the cell in its current matrix

Takes input from command line in following order
  Number of generations to simulate
  Dimensions of matrix (assume square matrix)
  Number of threads to use (when parallizing)
  Filename of the file containing the original matrix
  
Psuedocode
  For each generation
    For each row of the current matrix (Parallelize on rows of each matrix)
      For each column 
        Count the number of alive neighbors for specific cell
        Depending on number of alive neighbors, set the value for current cell in next matrix generation
  
Challenges
  Cannot parallelize on generations since previous generation is needed to make the upcoming generation
    Parallelize by analyzing the rows of a single matrix generation with threads
  Lost time when parallelizing --> inefficient use of threads
  Updating working matrix
    Must not update until every cell of next generation is determined
